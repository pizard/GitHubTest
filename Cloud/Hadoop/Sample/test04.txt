America's heart broke the day after Christmas when a young police officer in California was savagely murdered in
cold blood by an illegal alien, who just came across the border. The life of an American hero was stolen by someone
who had no right to be in our country. Day after day, precious lives are cut short by those who have violated our
borders. In California, an Air Force veteran was raped, murdered, and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal
alien with a long criminal history. In Georgia, an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing,
beheading, and dismembering his neighbor. In Maryland, MS-13 gang members who arrived in the United States as
unaccompanied minors were arrested and charged last year after viciously stabbing and beating a 16-year-old girl.
Over the last several years, I've met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigration.
I've held the hands of the weeping mothers and embraced the grief-stricken fathers. So sad. So terrible. I will never
forget the pain in their eyes, the tremble in their voices, and the sadness gripping their souls. How much more
American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?
To those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask: Imagine if it was your child, your
husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken? To every member of Congress: Pass a
bill that ends this crisis. To every citizen: Call Congress and tell them to finally, after all of these decades, secure our
border.
This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice. This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to
the American citizens we serve.
When I took the Oath of Office, I swore to protect our country. And that is what I will always do, so help me God.
Thank you and goodnight."

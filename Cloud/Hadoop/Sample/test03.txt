The border wall would very quickly pay for itself. The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year -- vastly
more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress. The wall will also be paid for, indirectly, by the great
new trade deal we have made with Mexico.
Senator Chuck Schumer -- who you will be hearing from later tonight -- has repeatedly supported a physical barrier
in the past, along with many other Democrats. They changed their mind only after I was elected President.
Democrats in Congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis. And they have refused to provide our brave border
agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation.
The federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund
border security. My administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation. But the
only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and re-opens the government. This
situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting. I have invited Congressional leadership to the White House
tomorrow to get this done. Hopefully, we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security.
Some have suggested a barrier is immoral. Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences, and gates around
their homes? They don't build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on
the inside. The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people
to be so horribly victimized

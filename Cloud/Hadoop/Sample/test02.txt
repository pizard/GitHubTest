Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States -- a dramatic increase. These
children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs. One in three women are sexually assaulted
on the dangerous trek up through Mexico. Women and children are the biggest victims, by far, of our broken system.
This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border. This is the cycle of human suffering that I am
determined to end.
My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs,
drug smugglers, and human traffickers. It's a tremendous problem. Our proposal was developed by law enforcement
professionals and border agents at the Department of Homeland Security. These are the resources they have
requested to properly perform their mission and keep America safe. In fact, safer than ever before.
The proposal from Homeland Security includes cutting-edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, illegal
contraband, and many other things. We have requested more agents, immigration judges, and bed space to process
the sharp rise in unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy. Our plan also contains an urgent request for
humanitarian assistance and medical support. Furthermore, we have asked Congress to close border security
loopholes so that illegal immigrant children can be safely and humanely returned back home.
Finally, as part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion
for a physical barrier. At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall. This barrier
is absolutely critical to border security. It's also what our professionals at the border want and need. This is just
common sense.

DONALD TRUMPâ€™S SPEECH IN FULL
"My fellow Americans: Tonight, I am speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at
our southern border. Every day, Customs and Border Patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying
to enter our country. We are out of space to hold them, and we have no way to promptly return them back home to
their country.
America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation. But
all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled, illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and
wages. Among those hardest hit are African Americans and Hispanic Americans.
Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.
Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90 percent of which floods across from our southern
border. More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War.
In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or
convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings. Over the years, thousands of Americans
have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we
don't act right now.
This is a humanitarian crisis -- a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul.
